This guide is for Vuejs version 2
VueJS is one of the best frameworks for JavaScript like ReactJS.
The VueJS is used to design the user interface layer, it is easy to pick up for any developers.
It is compatible with other libraries and extensions as well. If you want to create a single page 
application then VueJS is the first choice in my opinion. In the development field, there may be so many 
issues that can not be solved by using a single library, so the VueJS is compatible with other libraries so you can 
easily go for it. The VueJS is supported by all popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. You can easily compare 
this library with your favorite libraries.</p></h1>
