Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s
V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. You need to 
recollect that NodeJS isn’t a framework, and it’s not a programing language. It provides 
an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for 
building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.Most people are confused 
and understand it’s a framework or a programing language. We often use Node.js for building 
back-end services like APIs, Web App, or Mobile App. It’s utilized in production by large companies 
like Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, etc.</p></h3>
