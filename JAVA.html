<h3><p style="color:white">
Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. 
A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.
Java is fast, reliable and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming 
consoles, cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner.
Java is easy to learn and its syntax is simple and easy to understand. It is based 
on C++ (so easier for programmers who know C++). Java has removed many confusing and rarely-used features 
e.g. explicit pointers, operator overloading etc. Java also takes care of memory management and for that, 
it provides an automatic garbage collector. This collects the unused objects automatically.</p></h3>
