AngularJS was developed in 2008-2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons and is now maintained by Google. 
AngularJS is a Javascript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page
web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways
for developing web applications.It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML. Its features like dynamic binding 
and dependency injection eliminate the need for code that we have to write otherwise. AngularJS is rapidly growing
and because of this reason, we have different versions of AngularJs with the latest stable being 1.7.7. It is also
important to note that Angular is different from AngularJs. It is an open-source project which can be freely used and
changed by anyone. It extends HTML attributes with Directives, and data is bound with HTML.
